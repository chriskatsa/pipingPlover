Plovers depend on a variety of habitat types, including sand bars, tidal flats, and gently sloping beaches. During high tide, they rest above the water line, catching their breath before taking off for the next leg of their journey. When the tide recedes, plovers flock to the exposed sand flats and refuel on worms and crustaceans. As with their breeding sites, the primary threats are from habitat loss and disturbance.
